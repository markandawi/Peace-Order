    We are a group of students who wants to share more information about peace and order to our fellow students and teens. 
  Our country has a lot of laws for the peacefulness and orderliness of our country that we really don’t know. There 
  are a lot of issues that we are experiencing that are related to peace & order, and a lot of people are not aware about 
  it. Sometimes they are not aware that they are breaking the laws, even though it is a small sin when you start doing 
  it and you’re not the only one it will be a bigger problem. To have a peaceful and safe country, we must begin with ourselves.
