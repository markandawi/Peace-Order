			We are a group of students who wants to share more information about peace and order to our fellow students and teens. <br>
			Our country has a lot of laws for the peacefulness and orderliness of our country that we really don’t know. There<br> 
			are a lot of issues that we are experiencing that are related to peace & order, and a lot of people are not aware about<br> 
			it. Sometimes they are not aware that they are breaking the laws, even though it is a small sin when you start doing<br> 
			it and you’re not the only one it will be a bigger problem. To have a peaceful and safe country, we must begin with ourselves.<br>
