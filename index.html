				Traffic is one of the problems that people in baguio encounter. We mostly </br>
				experience this on long weekends, holidays and Panagbenga Festival. </br>
				</br>
				Causes of traffic:
				</br>
				</br>
				1. Lack of parking facilities. </br>
				2. Inappropriate parking. </br>
				3. Lack of traffic enforcers. </br>
				4. Large numbers of vehicles. </br>

				Closed-circuit television is installed had been one of the best evidence </br>
				for crimes that had been committed. A lot of criminals had been caught </br>
				because of these. In Baguio lots of these are now installed mostly in </br>
				crowded places where lots of pickpocketsâ€™ are located. Most of the streets </br>
				here in baguio, especially in town proper has CCTV. </br>

				<br>
				Jeepney is the cheapest transportation here in Baguio. And because of that <br>
				passengers need to fall in line and wait for their turn before they can enter. <br>
				Growing population in Baguio resulted to longer lines of passengers. <br>

				<b>Number Coding</b>
				<br>
				Number coding scheme is one of the ordinances here in Baguio City. This is strictly <br>
				implemented to lessen the number of vehicles per day and to control the traffic here <br>
				in Baguio City. This is being implemented by the time of 7am to 7pm from Monday to Friday. <br>
				This can be suspended by the advisory of the mayor. If you will violate this ordinance, you <br>
				are obliged to pay 500 pesos to get your license. <br>
				The car is prohibited if the plate number ends with these: <br>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				  <li>Monday: 1 or 2</li> <br>
				  <li>Tuesday: 3 or 4</li> <br>
				  <li>Wednesday: 5 or 6</li> <br>
