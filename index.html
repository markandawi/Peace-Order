					<h2>Duterte: Peace and order key to economic growth</h2>
				<h3>by Abner Macolor</h3>
					<p>PDP standard bearer and presidential race frontrunner Rodrigo Duterte graced the stage of the 2016 Presidential dialogues at the Peninsula Manila on Wednesday to present his economic agenda in front of the Makati Business Club (MBC) and Management Association of the Philippines (MAP).</p>
					<p>Duterte assured the audience that he is not the man he is being portrayed by some, ABS CBN News wrote.</p>
					<p>“I am castigated for being brutal and honest. It will be a bloody war, and for those who are already there, they will never go back,” he said.
					“You need a mayor to say: I am in charge.”</p>
	<p>“Progress and development cannot happen in place if there is insecurity caused by criminals and lawless elements. We must begin by addressing criminality, ensuring law and order, and I assure under my leadership you will feel the difference in six months,” sharing his all-out war against crime to the members and guest of MBC.</p>
<p>Once he is elected president, he will push for higher salaries for police and military to eradicate extortion, Manila Bulletin wrote.</p>
<p>“I will increase the salary of our police and military and equip them properly to fight criminality and I will reward those who performed their duties well,” he said.
Part of Duterte’s keynote speech is the significance of quality education and plans to equip public school teachers with training programs.</p>
<p>“I believe that our people of the Philippines, (their) greatest resource is education. They cannot go out of poverty unless we educate the people,” said Duterte.
He shared his plan on improving the mass transit and implementing infrastructure projects that were delayed under the previous administration due to “poor political will.”
He openly mentioned that he may adopt projects from past administrations that have given benefits to Filipinos.</p>
<p>“I will not hesitate to adopt the projects of Noynoy or Arroyo that are renowned and benefitted (many). Hindi ako mahiya mangopya [I am not ashamed copying (their projects)],” Duterte noted.
Duterte also shared that once he bags the presidency, he will provide P1 billion per region to support small enterprises in growing their businesses.</p>
<p>GMA News Online shared that the rough-talking mayor went on to deliver an expletive-ridden speech and went beyond the luncheon’s agenda, causing for the question-and-answer segment to be cancelled.</p>

					<h2>Bills to allow wiretapping of drug suspects to pass within year – Lacson</h2>
					<h3>by Tarra Quismundo </h3>
					<p>MANILA — Sen. Panfilo Lacson is optimistic that amendments to the Anti-Wiretapping Law could be passed within the year, expanding exemptions to the wiretap ban that would allow snooping on drug suspects in a bid to boost the administration’s war on the illicit trade.</p>
<p>This even while law enforcement agencies continued to deny it had wiretapping capability as the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs held its second hearing on the proposed amendments Tuesday afternoon.
“Within the year, that could be passed.  I am talso in talks with the House (of Representatives),” Lacson told.</p>

<p>Four separate bills authored by Lacson and Senators Gregorio Honasan, Grace Poe, Juan Edgardo Angara, are seeking to amend the Anti-Wiretapping Law of 1965 to include among exemptions violations of the 2002 Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.</p>
<p>Currently, the 51-year-old law penalizes the secret interception of private conversations but grants exemptions for limited situations: “cases involving the crimes of treason, espionage, provoking war and disloyalty in case of war, piracy, mutiny in the high seas, rebellion, conspiracy and proposal to commit rebellion, inciting to rebellion, sedition, conspiracy to commit sedition, inciting to sedition, kidnapping as defined by the Revised Penal Code, and violations of Commonwealth Act No. 616, punishing espionage and other offenses against national security.”</p>
<p>Under the proposed amendment, authorities may undertake wiretapping operations on particular targets when allowed by a court order.</p>
<p>“This will mean a lot. Without this, they only have one arm for punching. In my experience, we should rely more on technical intelligence. Ang human intelligence or HumInt, that’s just half of the overall effort. But technical intelligence or signal intelligence, that’s very useful yan,” said Lacson, a former national police chief.</p>
<p>Once approved, the law would allow authorities to intercept all forms of digital communications by their surveillance targets, whether phone calls and text messages, or emails and chats through applications that use internet connection.
He said the public would have nothing to worry about, as law enforcers would only undertake wiretapping operations on specific targets if allowed by the court.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s hearing, Lacson urged the Philippine National Police, the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to include in their respective 2017 budget proposals funding for the procurement of wiretapping equipment in preparation for the bill’s eventual passage.</p>
<p>Agency representatives all told Lacson’s committee Tuesday that they had no capability for any form of wiretapping, which Lacson doubted.
“I know they have,” Lacson said.</p>
<p>“But that’s part of their training. With their intel training, they are really prone to clamming up. I used to be there. I know how it feels… I can assume there are ongoing operations, and to divulge here with all of you (the media) present that they have such capability, that could drive their quarry away or take more precaution in conversing about illegal activities,” he said.

					<h2>PNP, AFP, Muslim leaders vow to prevent terror in Central Visayas</h2>
					<h3>by Ador Vincent Mayol</h3>
					<p>CEBU CITY – In attaining peace, collaboration is key.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Chief Supt. Noli Taliño, director of the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas (PRO-7), and Major General Raul del Rosario, commander of the Armed Forces’ Central Command, met with Muslim leaders in Cebu, on Tuesday, hoping to strengthen ties.</p>
<p>Some 30 local Muslim leaders went to the San Nicolas Proper Barangay Hall in Cebu City and vowed to support the government in maintaining peace and order in the community.</p>

<p>“Lahat tayo ay Pilipino. Iisang lahi ang pinangalingan natin. Walang Muslim o Kristiyano. Lahat tayo ang magkapareho. Magkapareha ang kulay ng ating dugo. Kaya, dapat tulong-tulong tayo sa ating inaasam na kapayapaan,” said Taliño while addressing the crowd gathered outside the barangay hall.  (All of us are Filipinos. We belong to the same race. There’s is neither Muslim nor Christian. We are equal. The same blood runs through our veins. And so, we should help each other attain the peace we all want).</p>
<p>Taliño, a former chief of the Special Action Force, said President Rodrigo Duterte has taken significant steps to eliminate illegal drugs, crimes, and corruption but that momentum has been threatened by a terrorist group.
“Masakit yong nangyari sa Davao City. Kung mawawala sana ang ganitong mga bagay, napakaganda sana ng ating kominidad. (The bomb attack in Davao was painful. If events like this vanish, we would have a better community),” he said.
Taliño said the support shown by the Muslim community in Cebu made him very happy.</p>
<p>“This really is a big help,” he said.</p>
<p>Malo Manunggiring, director of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos in Central Visayas, said the Muslim community in the region has been very supportive of law enforcers and the local government units for several years.
“What we do now is only to enhance what has already been achieved,” he told reporters.</p>
<p>“We understand each other. You accept us as your neighbors and we also compensate the respect you give us,” he added.
Manunggiring promised to monitor Muslims in the region so as to avert any terror attacks.</p>
<p>“We should police our ranks. We do it not just verbally but also in practice. Let us help our authorities and our President (Rodrigo Duterte),” he said.
Manunggiring condemned the bomb attack in a night market in Davao City last Friday that killed at least 15 people and wounded about 60 individuals.
“That is unIslamic. That has no place in Islam or in any other religion,” he said.</p>
<p>Major General Del Rosario said the Central Command has augmented the police force in the region to ensure the safety of the public.
“We have jointly intensified security in the seaports, airports, and other points of entry. The threats are always there. Even President Duterte’s own city, which was well secured, fell prey to bombing,” he said.
“Terrorists can strike anywhere. We have to be alert,” he added.</p>
<p>Both the PRO-7 and the Central Command have been placed under full alert status following the explosion in Davao City last Friday.
Taliño has ordered numerous checkpoints and sent additional troops on the field to ensure the safety of the public.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, President Duterte declared “a state of lawlessness” or “a state of lawless violence” to counter terrorism and strengthen the campaign against illegal drug trade.
Hours after the attack, Interior Secretary Mike Sueno said the Abu Sayyaf group claimed responsibility for the explosion in Davao City.</p>
<p>However, the terrorist group denied owning the attack. Muammar Askali alias Abu Ramie, the self-styled spokesperson of the Al Harakatul Al Islamiya, the Abu Sayyaf’s official name, pointed to an ally as that behind the deadly explosion.
In a phone call to the Philippine Daily Inquirer last Saturday, Askali said the group behind the blast was Daulat Ul Islamiya.  SFM</p>
